# Dash-Through-Time

A 2D platforming game created in the Unity engine. Play as a hero with the ability to dash and rewind through space. Encounter and overcome different obstacles and get to the end as fast as possible!

**Controls**
- Arrow Keys .......................................................... Move
- Space Bar .............................................................. Jump
- X ............................................................................... Rewind
- C................................................................................ Dash
- ESC........................................................................... Exit

All assets and code were created custom for this project. Key features in this game include:
- A custom character controller that uses raycasts for hit detection and allows for variable jump height, coyote time, jump buffering, wall jumping/sliding, dashing, and rewinding to a previous position.
- Multiple unique platform controllers that allow for a diverse play experience. Custom platform controllers allow for waypoint movement, spring jumping, and destruction on player detection.
- Custom cloud spawning system, particle effects, and trail renderer to improve game feel.
